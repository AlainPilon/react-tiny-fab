import { Playground } from 'docz'
import { Fab, Action } from 'react-tiny-fab';

# React Tiny Fab
## Install
```
   npm install react-tiny-fab
   yarn add react-tiny-fab

```
## Usage
There are two components available for import - `Fab` and `Action`. You import them like this:
```
   import { Fab, Action } from 'react-tiny-fab';
   import 'react-tiny-fab/styles.css';
```

## Example
Here is an example of how you would use the components:

<Playground>
  <Fab icon='testFab'>
   <Action
    text="testAction"
  />
  </Fab>
</Playground>

## Demo 
Check out the index.js file in the example folder for an example of the traditional FAB and also a form pop-up that could be used to send contact information, or something else.

## Contributing
If you find a bug, submit an issue with enough information to reproduce the bug. If you have a fix, please do not hesitate to submit a PR. If you feel that the API needs to be modified, open an issue so that we can discuss it first.
### Running the dev environment

* Clone the repo - `git clone https://github.com/dericgw/react-tiny-fab.git && cd react-tiny-fab`
* Install the dependencies - `npm i`
* Setup the example - `npm run setup-example`
* Start the dev environment (watches for changes and hot-reloads) - `npm run start`

Once you get that going, you should be able to make changes and the page should refresh automatically when those changes are saved.
Testing

This package is only one JS file and it is tested pretty good. Make sure that none of the tests are breaking if changes are made. Also, if you add new functionality and it warrants testing, please add tests. If you need help with this, I will gladly help.
